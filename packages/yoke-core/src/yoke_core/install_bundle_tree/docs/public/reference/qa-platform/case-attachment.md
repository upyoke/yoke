# Case attachment — which subject a QA case answers for

A `qa_requirements` row attaches to exactly one subject: an item, an epic
task, or a deployment run (optionally narrowed to one stage inside that run,
and one member item inside that stage). The polymorphic constraint enforcing
that shape lives in [qa-platform.md](../qa-platform.md); this page covers who
may author each shape, and what the shared reads return for it.

## Authoring

Item and deployment-run cases are the same registered write,
`qa.requirement.add`, distinguished by the target it names.

```text
yoke qa requirement add --item PREFIX-N \
  --method-id browser-check --qa-phase verification \
  --workflow-transition reviewing-implementation \
  --instructions "..." --expected-outcome "..." --method-config '{...}'
```

An item case is item-claim-gated: the calling session must hold the item's
active work claim. `--workflow-transition` is required and names a stage in
the item's pinned workflow that carries or precedes a `qa_verification` gate.

```text
yoke qa requirement add --deployment-run run-YYYYMMDD-NNN \
  --method-id browser-inspection --qa-phase post_deploy \
  [--deployment-stage STAGE [--deployment-member-item PREFIX-N]] \
  --instructions "..." --expected-outcome "..." --method-config '{...}'
```

A run case is authorized by the run's own project scope — the `qa_subject`
claim policy the rest of QA already writes under — and carries no workflow
transition, because its delivery run owns that context. It must name a method
(`--method-id`): what distinguishes a case from a bookkeeping row is that
something can execute it, and the plan-materialized acceptance kinds are
written by the run's own pipeline.

The command refuses, by name and with the recovery:

- a run that has already succeeded, failed, or been cancelled — its evidence
  is closed, and a case added afterwards would read as proof of something
  nobody ran;
- a stage the run's pinned flow does not declare, naming the stages it does;
- a member the run does not carry, naming the ones it does — run composition
  is frozen at start and is not widened by attaching a case;
- a member named without a stage, which storage models as a check *at* a
  stage and the subject constraint rejects half-named.

A hand-authored run case never carries `execution_target_json` /
`execution_target_digest`, which is what a stage's own gate matches on. It is
therefore additional evidence recorded against the run, never a silent gate on
a materialized admission it was never part of. Execute and read it back with
the same `yoke qa case run` and `yoke qa activity list` surfaces an item case
uses.

Epic-task attachment remains operator-debug only, through
`python3 -m yoke_core.domain.qa requirement-add --epic-id E --task-num K
--workflow-transition STAGE ...`.

## What the activity read returns

`qa.activity.list` is scoped to **executable** cases: a case is in scope when
it carries a plan or a registered `method_id`. That covers plan-backed cases
and equally covers a case attached straight to an item or a deployment run
without one — an item's own ad hoc verification and a hand-authored release
check are as visible as anything the pipeline materialized. What stays out is
the method-less bookkeeping row (an acceptance-criterion marker), which never
executes, so it has no run, verdict, or evidence to show.

Project scope comes from whichever subject the row names — its plan, its item
or epic, or its deployment run — and the projects join is inner, so a row
whose project cannot be resolved that way is readable by nobody rather than by
every tenant. A planless case reports `plan_id`, `plan`, and `case_key` as
`null`; readers name it by `method_name` / `method_id` instead. The day
`summary` is computed from the same source as the rows, so its counts cover
exactly the checks the rows sit beside.

## Naming where a case runs

A plan carries its own `target_environment_id`, so every case materialized
from it inherits one immutable execution target. A case attached without a
plan names its own with `--target-env NAME`, resolved against the project's
registered environments at execution time and held to each of these:

- the environment must be registered to that project and authorized for it,
  which is the same read a plan target passes;
- it must declare a reviewable address — `environments.url`, or `hosts.app` in
  its environment settings. An environment with neither is refused rather than
  bound, because a target carrying identity and no endpoint says the
  environment exists, never that the evidence came from it;
- when the case declares a `base_url` of its own, its origin must be that
  address. A case browsing somewhere else is refused.

Naming an environment is what a case opts into. A case that names none — an
item's own verification command, for instance — keeps running against
whatever its runner already resolves, with no execution target recorded.
