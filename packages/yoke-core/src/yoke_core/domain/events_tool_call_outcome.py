"""Tool-call outcome classifier for observe / dispatcher / sweep emitters.

This module owns the tool-call outcome enum and the single classifier
function. All event emitters that record a tool-call result import these
constants and call ``classify_tool_call_outcome`` so the
``event_outcome`` and ``exit_code`` columns on ``events`` carry one
consistent vocabulary.

Two distinct subsets live here:

Core classifier outcomes (emitted by ``classify_tool_call_outcome``):

* ``completed`` — clean success, exit_code 0 (or absent).
* ``failed`` — the tool reported failure (non-zero exit, error field,
  defense-in-depth reclassification).
* ``denied`` — a permission/policy decision blocked the call.
* ``interrupted`` — orphaned start sentinel-completed at session end.
* ``structured_exit`` — preserves the existing ``observe_event_emission``
  reshape that fires when ``structured_exit`` is in anomalies (e.g.
  ``Awaiting human approval``). This is a first-class outcome, not a
  variant of completed/failed, because downstream audit queries treat
  approval-gate exits as a distinct lifecycle event from real failures.

Event-class-conditional outcomes (emitted only by ``HarnessToolCallDenied``
lint guardrails via ``emit_denial_event``, never by the classifier):

* ``warn`` — warn-mode lint hit. The guardrail recorded an audit row but
  did not block. CLAUDE.md ``## Command Output — Hard Rule`` documents
  this as required audit-trail behavior.
* ``suppression_attempted`` — operator placed a ``# lint:no-*-check``
  suppression token on the command body. The guardrail still denied; the
  token is honoured ONLY as audit evidence so reviewers can grep bypass
  attempts. CLAUDE.md ``## Destructive Operation Discipline`` documents
  the symmetry.

The classifier is a pure function: no I/O, no DB, no side effects. Neither
``warn`` nor ``suppression_attempted`` is in ``FAILED_OUTCOMES`` — they
are audit signals, not real denials, so ``events list --failed-only``
must not sweep them in.

       Permission/policy denial — the harness refused to execute.
    2. ``structured_exit in anomalies`` -> ``(structured_exit, exit_code)``.
       Preserves the existing observe_event_emission reshape for
       approval-gate exits.
    3. ``is_failure`` -> ``(failed, exit_code)``.
       The parser already classified this as a failure (top-level error,
       defense-in-depth hard-failure text, Codex transcript reconcile).
    4. ``exit_code is not None and exit_code > 0`` -> ``(failed, exit_code)``.
       Defense in depth: a parsed nonzero exit that somehow escaped the
       upstream ``is_failure`` flip still records the truth.
    5. otherwise -> ``(completed, exit_code or 0)``.

    The returned outcome is always a member of :data:`OUTCOMES`.
