"""Offer-envelope merge: preserve non-offer-owned keys across writes.

``harness_sessions.offer_envelope`` is a JSON blob with multiple writers.
The session-offer code path writes per-offer identity/step fields; other
code paths (chain skip memory, chain checkpoint, codex thread id,
execution-scope scratch) deposit cross-offer state that must survive
between offers. This module merges per-offer fields over the existing
envelope so unknown keys, preserved cross-offer keys, and offer-owned
keys all land with the intended semantics.

The merge is value-level (``dict.update``), not deep — every top-level
envelope key is independent. The two named sets (``OFFER_WRITE_OWNED_KEYS``,
``PRESERVED_KEYS``) are documentation and lint anchors, not runtime gates:
``merge_offer_envelope`` already preserves every key the per-offer dict
omits, so adding a future preserved key is a one-line edit to the
``PRESERVED_KEYS`` set plus matching coverage in
``runtime/api/test_sessions_offer_envelope_preservation.py``.

The function tolerates missing, empty-string, malformed-JSON, and
non-dict existing envelopes by returning the per-offer dict unchanged.
``harness_sessions.offer_envelope`` is ``TEXT``/JSON; readers
(``read_chain_checkpoint``, ``read_chain_skip_memory``,
``frontier_recent_owner._checkpoint_outcome``, the route-defense
exclusion path) all tolerate malformed input, so this merger preserves
the same robustness contract.
